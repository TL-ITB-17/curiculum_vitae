abstract: The paper industry is an industry that produces large amounts of liquid waste. In addition, the content of pollutant parameters in the paper coloring process is very high. Based on East Java Governor no. 72 of 2013 there are 5 quality standards for wastewater that must be met before being discharged into water bodies. The parameters that need to be processed are pH, COD, BOD, TSS, and Pb. In the design used primary data in the form of debit data and waste characteristics taken from the fine paper industry of PT. Sido Sidoarjo. Waste treated comes from the paper coloring process. Characteristics of treated waste have a value of TSS41000 mg / l, COD 45384 mg / l, BOD 8300 mg / l, Pb 0.56 mg / l and pH 7.7. The planned WWTP unit consists of precedimentation, equalization tanks, fast stirring tanks , slow stirrer, sedimentation 2, and ABR-ABF. Calculation of BOQ and RAB using HSPK Surabaya City 2015 and obtained a figure of Rp217,650,760 for the construction of all units of WWTP.
